# Momentum

Deploy: https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/saratovkin-JSFE2021Q3/momentum/

This is a remake of the popular Google Chrome extension named Momentum.

Application Functionality:
- App will display the current time and a mathcing greeting.
- Using the Music widget, user can play one of four tracks. (player is completely custom).
- Another avaliable widget is Weather. User can find any city by using search.
- Also user can change background in Settings. There are 3 different sources and ability to search images by tag.
- Finally, there is a link saving Widget, that actually saves links ðŸ˜„. 

My first experience with public APIs (Flickr, Unsplash, OpenWeather) and second web application ever.

Unfortunately this app is not adaptive or responsive and it will look terrible on devices with a less than 800px vertical resoultion.

Maybe I'll add an adaptive layout later, but originally this is a desktop extension and I think it's not supposted to be opened on a phone.

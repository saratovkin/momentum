## About

My first experience with public APIs (Flickr, Unsplash, OpenWeather) and second web application ever.

Unfortunately this app is not adaptive or responsive and it will look terrible on devices with a less than 800px vertical resoultion.

Maybe I'll add an adaptive layout later, but originally this is a desktop extension and I think it's not supposted to be opened on a phone.
